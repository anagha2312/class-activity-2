## Assumptions
1. For the birthplace images, I've used placeholder images that should be replaced with actual images from my hometown.  
2. The CV PDF file contains the information from my resume formatted appropriately.  
3. For the text analyzer tool, I've assumed that:  
   - Users will paste text with at least 10,000 words  
   - The tool analyzes and displays results on the same page  
   - Special symbols include all non-alphabetic characters  
Some LLM prompts

3.How do I add a download link for a PDF resume on my website?
4.Can you suggest a folder structure for organizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and documents in a personal website project?
5.Create a simple script that highlights the most frequent words in a block of text.
